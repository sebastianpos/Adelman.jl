# Adelman.jl

This software provides a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) front-end for Adelman categories of the [CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project/).

## Installation

Download the repository and execute the file `src/Adelman.jl` in Julia.

Note that this software depends on the Julia package [CapAndHomalg](https://github.com/homalg-project/CapAndHomalg.jl) which in turn depends on the computer algebra system [OSCAR](https://oscar.computeralgebra.de/).

## Run the notebooks interactively in your browser

The notebooks are best viewed on the [jupyter nbviewer page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sebastianpos/Adelman.jl/tree/master/worksheets/).
There you can also interactively run the notebooks online by clicking on `Binder`'s three-circle-logo (tooltip `Execute on Binder`) at the top-right corner.
